# Integrate Blogs in Your Next.js Project

This guide explains how to integrate blogs in your Next.js project. For projects with a `src` folder, this process should work as-is. For projects with an `app` folder, you'll need to adjust the path accordingly.

### How to Use

To get started, run the following command:

```
npx nextjs-blog-cli
```

This will give you two theme options:

- Theme 1
- Theme 2

You can preview each theme by visiting the following URLs:

- Theme 1: <https://www.rajatdhoot.com/theme-1>
- Theme 2: <https://www.rajatdhoot.com/blog>
